 <img src="Jane.JPG"alt= "Smiley face" style="float:left"> <p2>Jane Eyre is the story of a young, orphaned girl (shockingly, she's named Jane Eyre) who lives with her
   at Gateshead Hall. Like all nineteenth-century orphans, 
   her situation pretty much sucks. Mrs. Reed hates Jane and allows her son John to torment the girl. </p2>

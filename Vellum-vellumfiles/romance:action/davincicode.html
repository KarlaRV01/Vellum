 <img src="DaVinciCode.JPG"alt= "Smiley face" style="float:left"> <p2>A murder in Paris' Louvre Museum and cryptic clues in some
   of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery. For 2,000 years a secret society 
   closely guards information that -- should it come to light -- could rock the very foundations of Christianity. </p2>
